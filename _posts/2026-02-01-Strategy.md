This is the third of my mini projects. This program takes data from the user such as: number of stints, tyres used for each stint and the amount of laps on each stint. It then runs a calculation function (which takes into account factors such as type of tyre, box time and the degredation). The function returns the time in hours that the race would take if the inputted strategy was used.
This program is useful to play around with and trial and error different race strategies to eventually tune a rough, optimised strategy. The development of this program was useful to understand more about the effects of tyre degredation and how much the timing of a pitstop can affect a race. For instance the difference between running 16 laps on a soft and 30 on a medium can result in a vastly different time than say 20 laps on a soft and 26 laps on a medium. The balance you need to find is critical for a race. 

```python
racetime = 0

lap_times = {"soft" : 90,
           "medium" : 91,
           "hard" : 92
           }

def tyre_strategy(num_stints,stints):

    for x in range(0,int(num_stints)):
        tyre = input("Tyre: ")
        laps = input("Laps: ")
        stints.append({"tyre": tyre.lower(), "laps": laps})
    return(stints)

def calculator(num_stints,stints,racetime,box_time):
    for x in range (0,(int(num_stints))):
        for i in range(0,int(stints[x]["laps"])):
            racetime += float(lap_times[stints[x]["tyre"]])
            lap_times[stints[x]["tyre"]] += 0.2
    racetime += box_time
    racetime = float(racetime/3600)
    racetime = round(racetime,3)
    return(racetime)
           
stints = []
num_stints = input("How many stints are you doing ")
box_time = 25 * (int(num_stints) - 1)

tyre_strategy(num_stints,stints)
print(str(calculator(num_stints,stints,racetime,box_time)) + " Is the total race time in hours")
```
